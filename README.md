If you need more arguements from the terminal increase the MAX_ARGUEMENTS variable.

Compile and try :)

This is probably useless but hey it works.

USAGE:

``gcc "valgrind runner.c" -o valgrind``

``./valgrind a.out [arg arg]``

Pls don't do ./valgrind valgrind valgrind valgrind and don't use more than MAX_CHARACTERS variable for arguements.
